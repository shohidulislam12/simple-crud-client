Task Management & Admin Dashboard Project
Short Description
This project is a comprehensive Task Management and Admin Dashboard application. The application allows users to:

Task Management:
Register, log in, and manage tasks (create, update, delete, drag & drop between statuses).
Persist tasks in a MongoDB database with real-time updates.
Admin Dashboard:
View, add, update, and delete records such as user or student information.
The dashboard features a modern and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
The project uses a full-stack approach with a React (Vite) frontend and an Express.js/MongoDB backend.
